1. Required packages: numpy, scipy, caffe, PLT, Tkinter, opencv, matplotlib.pyplot, skimage.color, ntpath, Tkconstants, tkFileDialog
2. Install the required packages on the PC.
3. To color an image:
	- Execute "gui.py": opens an application named "VANGOGH"
	- Click browse and select the black and white image
	- The image is colored and displayed in the application along with the black and white image
	- To see the black and white image click "SHOW B/W" and to see the colored image click "SHOW COLOR"
4. To color a video:
	- Create the frames: exectue create_frames.py. This takes video file (name.mp4) as argument. 
		(Eg: python create_frames.py video.mp4)
		This breaks the video into frames and saves them in the folder named "frames"
	- Color the frames: execute color_frames.py. This takes number of frames as argument. 
		Check the number of frames in the folder "frames". 
		(Eg: python color_frames.py 100)
		This colors the frames that are in the folder "frames" and saves them in "colored"
	- Get the video (colored): execute create_video.py. This takes number of frames as argument.
		(Eg: python create_video.py 100)
		This creates the video from the frames in the folder "colored" and saves it in "colored_videos"
